### Hi there, I'm Dominik ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineer that enjoys creating reliable and efficient software. I have commercial experience in **Java** and **Typescript** (mostly with **Angular**), and I've also worked on projects using **Vue** and **Rust** (which I love! ðŸ¦€).

Here's a fun little graph that shows my most-used languages:

(Caveat: This only shows my visible repositories, so there's likely much more Rust and Vue in my private repository chaos.)
